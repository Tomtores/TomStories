# Alien Photographer  

It was damp and cold. And, of course, very dark and moderately scary.  
Chasing-Perfect-Image-Of-Still-Nature, or 'Chifs', as humans called him, was lodged between two stones, listening to a local guide describing the cave in the light of a powerful searchlight. The guide was human. Nobody sane crawled into caves. The three soldiers behind him were also human, because nobody sane walked in wild reaches without armed humans. The guide was not a soldier, but most likely had a small gun on them too, just in case, like all humans do.  
Chifs wasn't armed. Not in the conventional sense, at least. He still did a fair deal of shooting.  
Preliminary low-light scans said, that the spot he was standing on, was a good place to take a picture.   
Chifs was a photographer, a good one, and his fellow professionals called him slightly crazy.  
He tended to agree, as no sane person would venture deep into the unknown cave, to find who knows what, and get eaten by some darkness-dwelling monsters. But, it made for some unique shots. The cavern chamber ahead of them was just huge, the other end unseen in total darkness. There was an underground lake, dropping water, an echo, and other odd sounds. And he really wanted to see what was on the other side.  
He took the cover off his main camera, set the flash to high, and called out:  
"Cover your eyes! I am not joking, eyes shut!"  
He then lifted the apparatus above his head, locked his arms and pressed the button, making sure he was not looking anywhere where the camera pointed at.  
Through closed eyelids, he saw several more and more intensifying flashes, cumulating in one that made his world white even through closed eyes.  
He regained his vision after a couple seconds, to the sight of a perfect photo and sound of hissing steam. A normal result of using Ultra-Flash (TM) in enclosed rooms.  
– Holy crap, what was that? – one of humans exclaimed.  
– That was an Ultra-Flash (TM) – he explained. – Does everybody still have their eyeballs? –  
The soldier behind him counted the group and confirmed – Yeah, we're fine.  
– Good. The photo went splendid.   
– Why does it blink several times when it charges? – asked one of the soldiers.  
– Oh, humanitarian reasons. – Chifs said in a smug tone, putting the cover back on. – I set it to ramp the brightness up in several long flashes, so everything sensitive to light can run for cover. Which is why I'm never going to catch any living creatures in my photos. But I prefer a still nature anyway.  
– That's one damn powerful flash – one of the humans commented.  
– You have no idea. – Chifs smiled. – But coming from a human, I'll take that as compliment.  
– Couldn't you use a tripod and longer exposure times, instead of frying everything with light? – suggested another.  
– My exosuit locks up during photo, functionally working as a tripod. – Chifs raised his arm to present the composite beams enclosing his arms. – But sometimes, you just need a good light. The photo I just took is enough for a detailed 3d tour of the cave.  
– Neat.  
– How strong is that flash? – another human asked.  
– At maximum setting? It strips paint.  
– No way.  
– I'll show you when we're outside. I know you humans love these kinds of things.  

The cave trip lasted two more hours before they reached the end of the "easily accessible" part. The less accessible one required crawling under very unwelcoming rocks, and the guide said the rest of the cave was partially flooded and only appealing to cave spelunkers, but no large chambers to gawk at.  
Chasing-Perfect-Image-Of-Still-Nature had his limits, as to where he would crawl, so he commanded the whole group to make its way back, to the visible relief of the guide and most of the soldiers.  

Once outside, they rejoined the rest of the group, reporting no casualties, and recapping several hours long trip as "saw some fancy rocks". Humans reminded him that he was to show the capabilities of his flash.  
Smiling, he asked them for one of their fire sticks (humans called them storm matches), stuck it between two stones on an otherwise barren cliff, took two steps back, shouted "clear!", and flashed a photo.  
The humans yelped with surprise, seeing the match lit on fire. And all the front-facing-parts of the stick charred.  
– What is this thing powered with?  
– Fusion cell. Don't worry, I have a licence.  
– Damn. That's powerful.  
– That was a medium setting. Imagine what it does on max – he boasted. – No human, you can't use it to blow things up! – Chifs spoke, holding his hand up like a professor in the lecture – The manufacturer ensured this. But you could probably run our shuttle on it, in a pinch. –  
Speaking of shuttle, it was time to return to main camp. He had a lot of good photos from the route here, with the extremely detailed photo of the main chamber as his crown prize. He planned on making some try shots of wildlife during the way back, if they managed to stalk any. Just in case, he locked the flash at the lowest setting, to not hurt anything.  

***  

Three hours later...  

– Why are they shooting at us? – yelled Chifs, sitting under a large stone. Enemy bullets zipped by at random. Yes, they were using physical bullets, an ancient technology. And so were the humans.  
– We are intruders here – explained a large human to his left, the leader of the group.  
– We are leaving!   
– How about you tell them that? – human remarked, popping up to send a couple of rounds, then dropped back to cover.  
– I don't speak their language!  
– Neither do I! Just sit tight until they get tired! –  
Chifs patiently sat tight for three minutes before he remarked:  
– I do not think they are getting tired!  
– Neither do I! Squad, any exit routes?  
– Negative. We're pinned down!  
– Well damn, we'll have to shoot our way through. I need an opening!  
– Humans, cover your eyes! – Chifs shouted.  
The couple nearest gave him a puzzled look, then saw him holding the camera, backwards, with the murder flash on top,  
they shouted something, and the whole group ducked at once.  
Chifs reached his arm up and triggered the flash.  
The jungle in front of him became white for a moment.  
The jungle behind him was probably on fire now.  
Humans jumped up from the cover and started firing, calling "tango down!".  
– We good? – asked Chifs, when the fire died out.  
He got answered by several more bullets, ricocheting into the trees.  
– No, there are more of them. In this direction – human Dave, his protector-in-charge, pointed to the right. – You have more of that flashy thing?  
– Charged and ready. Just give me a sign. –  
Dave called all to duck and Chifs reached out.  
There was sound of shots, and his arm was pulled forward.  
The Ultra-Flash (TM) landed two meters in front of them, broken.  
Well, fuck... here go his quarterly savings.  
– Chifs, you ok buddy?! – the human Dave was already over him, inspecting his arm.   
– I'm fine, exosuit took the hit. But the Ultra Flash (TM) is a toast.  
– Yeah, sorry about that – human said, giving a longing glance to the broken device. – We'll try to fix it at the base.  
– How about we get out of here in one piece, *then* worry about gear? – Chifs fumed.  
– We're workin' on that! – squad leader shouted.  
The firing continued.  
Chifs sighed, updating his will, citing nephew as the inheritor of the latest photos. He didn't trust his brother with them.  
After that, Chifs reached into his toolbelt, for one of the small cubes. He typed in the elevation and called to Dave.  
– Hey, Dave, can you throw this at enemy positions?  
– What's that? – human asked, grabbing the cube.  
– It's a flash cube. For making area bright for shots.  
– Cool. Do I press a button or what?  
– It will trigger on descent. Just throw.  
– Fire in the hole, guys! – Dave called, then took a swing.  
Everyone hit the ground. There was a several-second-long pause, where nothing happened.  
Then a white flash.  
Humans jumped up and resumed shooting, calling couple successful hits.  
– You did them good, little guy! Have more? –  
Chifs just silently handed him another cube.  
Human Dave reached out and thrown it.  
A rifle sounded out. And Dave fell back.  
– Dave! – Chifs screamed, seeing a human falling on his back, with an ominous hole in his upper body. – Dave has been hit! – he yelled, crawling forward to grab human by the leg, and pull him closer to his stone hideout. They left a red smear on the ground.  
There was a movement, as the squad leader jumped in behind the rock, looked at Dave and concluded "he'll be fine", before running further.  
Chifs cursed, laying on top of human, and applying a patch from his universal medkit. Well, it was mostly geared for burns, but universal paste worked just fine to stop the bleeding from a human's shoulder.  
Dave patted him on the back, saying he is fine.  
– Now this got personal – grumbled Chifs.   
He reached into his backpack, and deployed a small drone.  
– Hey, squad leader, do you want eyes in the sky? – he called to the group lead.  
– Can it shoot lazers?  
– This is a civilian drone!  
– How about dropping bombs?  
– Do you have any?? – photographer squeaked helplessly.  
– Oi! Demolition John! Have any of those landmines? – the squad leader waved to human on the other side of the group.  
– Five, why? – a man on the right, with a large backpack, replied.  
– We got a drone.  
– Cool! Come over here! –  
Chifs looked at less than ideal cover on the route to the bulky man, froze in place, and intensely shook his head.  
The man sighed, and rolled to him instead.  
Humans should not be rolling like that. Not with the amount of extra gear on the body!  
The soldier was now by him, holding several round objects and a duct tape at the ready.  
– What's the lift limit? – human asked, inspecting the drone.  
– It can carry my 30-kilo camera, but flies really slow then.  
– Cool. Three mines then.  
– I would prefer to not blow the drone up – noted Chifs.  
The drone was quite expensive.  
– You have any remote triggers? – soldier asked, gluing the mines together.  
– The camera mount swivels, if you can do anything with that.  
– That will do. –  
Human quickly strapped the mines with duct tape, told him how to release the payload, and held the whole assembly as the drone lifted up. Chifs *very carefully* flew forward, not wanting to drop the cargo on his group. Human sat beside him, explaining where to go next. They circled the drone over the forest to the right, to avoid enemy detection. He turned on the thermal overlay, then beelined for biggest group. Just as he was above them, he swivelled the camera mount. Sudden jerk told him the payload went down.  
There was a sizeable explosion.  
– Good one! – the Demolition John slapped him on the arm, when they saw the explosion on the camera feed.   
Normally Chifs would be mad at such rough treatment, but exosuit took it, so he didn't even feel it much.  
Human John went back to his shooting position, and Chifs linked his video feed to the squad leader, circling over enemy soldiers... or native tribe or whatever they were.  
The fight slowly died out, as the enemy's sizeable force realized most of their friends are wounded or dead.  
Until Chifs spotted something large moving on thermals. He shown it to Dave sitting next to him.  
– Guys! – shouted Dave – these fuckers have an APC!  
– Which one? – squad leader yelled, busy shooting at couple natives trying to flank them.  
– Old junker, but we ain't gotta anything to take it down, unless one of you fancy sneaking there with a mine! –  
The APC got in range and started shooting at the drone. After a couple seconds, it went down. Then they felt a rain of bullets as APC started shooting at their positions.  
– Well, shit – Chifs cursed.  
– I need the drone and a landmine – yelled squad leader.  
– We just lost the drone! The drone is down!  
– Fuck it. I need a big boom, and I need it now!  
– The flash doohickey – Dave pointed from the spot he was sitting – it has a fusion cell! –  
Demolition John jumped to the broken device, then back to Chifs and Dave's hiding spot.  
– The device is designed to not blow up under any circumstances – informed him Chifs.  
– I'm still gonna try! – human replied, trying to rip the cover off with a knife.  
– Of course you do. Gimme that – Chifs took the Ultra Flash (TM) from human, switched his gauntlet to utility mode and unscrewed the backplate. The fusion core was now exposed for the human to rip it out and do whatever he wanted.  
– Wait, leave it in – human said. He poked one of the components with the knife – If we short his, we can overload the cell.  
– That won't work – protested the photographer.  
– Trust me, I know how this works.  
– These leads?  
– Yup. –  
Chifs welded the wires shut with his portable welder.  
The device started buzzing ominously and the fusion cell begun to glow, in a way fusion cells should **not** glow.  
– I hate you humans, turning everything into explosives! – he grumbled in a panicky, rising tone, quickly handing the device to the explosives expert.  
– Here goes nothing! – the human screamed, throwing the homemade Ultra Flash (TM) grenade in the direction of the enemy.  
For long seconds, there was nothing.  
Then the ground shook.  
There must have been a sound of some kind, but Chifs didn't hear anything.  
A wave of hot air blew past them, dropping some trees. *Then* he heard the sound, or rather, begun hearing the ringing in his ears.  
His suit built-in radiation counter squeaked in "You just got hit by a nuke!" chirp.  
The firefight ceased.  
Humans didn't wait to see if it resumes.  
One of them took Dave under arm, the other grabbed Chifs by his exosuit's service handle, and they sped away from the area.  
Chiefs half consciously snapped some photos of burning forest, and a mushroom cloud. He began to wonder if his insurance covers nuclear explosions and setting woods on fire.  

***  

They only stopped when once they were safely beyond the hill and hidden in a small tree clump. The squad leader ordered a head-count. One missing. The local guide. "He must have run away" concluded squad leader and ordered a walk back to the camp, without looking for the guy. That was odd, for humans, but Chifs was not much eager to come back and look either. Several of the soldiers were wounded, but, surprisingly, no one was lost. They patched them up within minutes, distributed the gear and picked up a marching pace. Chifs was happy his exosuit did the actual walking for him, but he was getting cramps in the joints anyway.  
They made it halfway back to the camp, when they heard whirring and saw lights. The whole group fell into the trees, like they were never there, with Chifs tossed to the ground and laying under the crushing weight of 150-kilo monster called 'Dave'.  
One of soldiers called "friendlies!".  

Human vehicles.  
Several of them.  
They were full of camp soldiers.   
And their guide was among them.  
So he *did* run away.  
Or didn't?  
Does it count as running, if you are not part of the security detail *AND* you bring back a dozen of armed people as a backup?  
Chifs was too tired to consider this philosophical dilemma, instead just collapsing onto the seat. Dave crashed next to him, asking for some ice.  
They loaded the rest of the people into the jeeps and rode home, joking about the encounter.  

***  

At the camp, they threw him a party, saying "A photographer saved our asses".  
They even chipped in some credits for new Ultra Flash (TM) and a drone.  
He didn't dare tell them how much they actually cost, and refused the money.  
They stayed in the area for a couple more weeks, documenting less dangerous things and never going back near the natives' territory.  

In total, the trip was a success, albeit a very stressing one. Chifs decided to never ever go into places humans describe as "we'll probably be ok".  
Until next time, at least.  
He had a lot of material to work with, including photos of wounded Dave, used with permission. His first official shots of live nature.  
And of course his crown prize – the detailed, pristine quality, photo of an inaccessible cave on a remote planet far away from Galaxy Alliance territories. He hoped for a decent prize in the yearly contest. Even third place would help him rebuy the lost equipment. And maybe live on student meals for half a year. And if it didn't... well, they are all still in one piece, that's what counts, right?  
He really hoped the cave photo was worth the losses.  

***  

And surprisingly, he won.  
But it wasn't the cave picture, that won him an award for photo of the year.  
No, it was a grainy, low quality image from the drone built-in camera. A series of images, in fact.  
Falling landmines.  
A surprised native's face.  
Dusty explosion.  
And a body ragdolling away.  
He blamed his nephew, the editor, for including what amounted to proof of murder, titling it "Surprise Delivery".  

Chasing-Perfect-Image-Of-Still-Nature really hated this photo. And he was not happy with the award. But money was money. Enough to replace the lost equipment, and cover his living costs for a year.

Galaxy News snippet:  

– Chasing-Perfect-Image-Of-Still-Nature, did you really use your equipment as a nuke against natives?  
– That was purely an accident. I was making a photo of the natives when one of them shot my Ultra Flash (TM). The fusion cell became unstable, so human had to throw it away from us. Unfortunately, by force of habit, he threw it in the direction of attacking natives. I deeply regret the accident. We were not able to scout the area for survivors, as we had to leave immediately due to radiation.  
– We heard you also lost a Mark VI drone in the area. What about the advanced tech contamination protocols?  
– The drone was in the range of the explosion, it is not likely anything usable survived.  
– Could you tell us more about the drone?  
– Well, it has served me for many years. I had it equipped with thermal imaging and better cameras.  
– Why thermal imaging?  
– Oh, you would be surprised how many scientists want to buy my thermal images of remote planets. They bring surprising amount of biological and structural information. It is also an invaluable tool when doing search and rescue.  
– Search and rescue?  
– Yes. I have used my drone several times to find missing people. It gets much easier with thermal imaging. Once I found a child that was about to be attacked by a local predator.  
– Did the rescue teams make it in time?  
– They did. I actually chased the predator off by firing flash and ramming it with a drone. The child parents were rejoiced. You can see a photo of me with the saved child, on my photo feed.  
<Here you can see injected photography of Chasing-Perfect-Image-Of-Still-Nature, in his exosuit, sitting in a hovercraft – next to him a small blue-skinned child, giving him a hug. They are both looking at the control pad for the drone. The drone is not in the image, but the photo was taken from outside the open hatch, presumably by the drone itself.>  
– You must be a real hero!  
– Just doing my part.      

  
***  

Couple months later...  

"General, your guest is here." – a secretary announced through intercom.  
– What did he want again?  
– A permit for Mark VII **M** drone.  
– **M** version is reserved strictly for military use.  
– He says he will try to convince you anyway.  
– Fine, let him in.  

Chifs walked in, to face an old looking General of Supply.  

– Hello, general. I am Chasing-Perfect-Image-Of-Still-Nature, but you probably know me better as "That photographer who dropped a landmine on natives"   
– You made that photo?  
– Yes.  
– I see. What do you want?  
– In short? Your signature on a permit for mark VII M drone.  
– These are reserved for military.  
– I know. I need your signature to get permit for one.  
– Why would I give you one? – old general crossed his arms, inspecting the guest.  
– General, I will be short – Chifs gestured to the side – I already took part in two firefights, as an observer, and three search and rescue missions – he counted on his fingers. – I had to fend off a predator with flash. I dropped landmines on natives shooting at us. I do not expect this trend to change, and I would like to have something sturdier than my old Mark VI drone.  
– What happened to it?  
– Show down by an armored vehicle. –  
General stared at him for a while, trying to deduct if he was lying. It didn't sound like a lie.  
– So you want something that does not go down after a single hit.  
– Yes. –  
The general looked to his trophy wall, to the old photography of a military squad he once commanded.  
– Are you here to join an army?  
– Not if I can help it, sir – his guest nodded with respect.  
– I do not know if legal would allow me to grant access to a military drone, to a civilian. – General mused, staring at his trophy wall.  
– I have inquired with them, and they will allow it, if you sign the permit. – Chifs explained.  
General walked to his desk, checking pending documents. One from legal. A permit.  
– Fine. I will sign the permit. But we don't want to be associated with any shit you pull off, understood?  
– Yes sir.  
– The legal will handle the rest.  
– Thank you, sir.  

***  

Two months later, Chasing-Perfect-Image-Of-Still-Nature was at the spaceport on a border world of the Galaxy Alliance.   
He finally got the promised drone from military supply HQ, with weapons removed of course.  
The Mark VII M was easily three times heavier than his regular civilian drone version. The only reason they shared a number was because they used the same advanced control cluster.   
The weapons have been removed, leaving two square holes in the front plate, but, curiously, they did not remove any other systems.   
Like active camouflage.   
Which was going to be a godsend for his type of work. Now he could make the photos on low tech race territories with them being no wiser he was there! The drone also had an internal bay, large enough to fit couple missiles, an enhanced sensor pod, or, with a 3d-printed bracket, his largest camera.  
Chifs was currently grinning like a child who got his hand on the newest racing-drone.  
He spent a lot for the privilege, almost all his winnings from the "Photo of the Year", including a couple bribes to even be able to talk to the general, but here it was, his dream drone platform.  
He immediately packed up after receiving it and sped to spaceport, in case it was a clerical error, and he was not supposed to get it. The first flight from his home planet to the main transport hub on the edge of Galaxy Alliance systems went uneventfully, nobody even checked his bags.  
Now he had to get himself and his gear to the other side of the border, into the wild External Systems.  
It should not be too hard, the port security was focused on keeping weapons and other dangerous objects *out* of the Galaxy Alliance space, not keeping them in.  
Some of his gear, like the Ultra Flash (TM), he wasn't even allowed to take back into GA space and had to deposit it at the border whenever he came back to his home planet to visit family. But taking his newly purchased replacement out of the GA space, with all manufacturer seals intact, should not be hard.   
The line was moving moderately fast. He had blocked the space behind him with his luggage, to suggest other passengers to take other lanes. And to be honest, he had a lot of luggage.  
His turn came in, and he warned the security worker that he has some unusual cargo.  
The worker looked over the Ultra Flash (TM) casing with lack of interest, then put it into the standard scan machine.  
It triggered quite an annoying alert. And a couple of guards came running.  
Chifs sighed, holding up a datapad with the permit, and giving the worker "I told you so" gaze.  
Both worker and guards inspected the casing, growing more and more worried as they inspected the safety labels.  
Sure, he had the full manufacturer certificate of safety ready on him.  
The worker had to call his manager.   

– Line manager, I need your assistance.  
– What for?  
– I have a guy with fusion cell at security check 53.  
– He is checking in a *shuttle*?  
– No, it's part of a handheld device for making photos.  
– A handheld device? You are making fun of me, line worker!  
– I'm forwarding the case to your terminal, sir. He has a permit.  
There was a pause as the manager inspected scanner readings.  
– Did you check the permit?  
– Yes. Permit and safety certificate. All valid. I just need your approval to let it through.  
– Ok. Done – manager waved dismissively.  
– Thank you, sir.  
    
The checkpoint worker put down his communication device, waited for the screen to show green, and waved Chifs over to pass.  
– This next – Chifs pointed to a large black case, smiling slightly.  
He already asked the security guards to stay earlier, and now observed as the poor checkpoint worker wheeled the case into the large scan machine.  
There was another alert. The guards gave him a questioning look and went to look at the screen. They returned with the checkpoint worker, to Chifs politely holding his another permit.   

– Line manager – called the phone – I need your assistance here.  
– Just send it to my terminal and I'll approve it.  
– I can't. I need you physically here.  
– Why?  
– The guy is checking in a military drone.  
– Is he a soldier?  
– No sir, positively a civilian. Says he has a permit.  
– Then check the damn permit! – the line manager hissed.  
– I can't, sir.  
– What do you mean you can't? That's your job! Checking the damn permits!  
– The permit requires C3 security clearance to view. And I'm only C2. I can't even forward it through the terminal, so I need you to come down here, in person, sir. Please?  
– Fine. I'm coming.  

Couple minutes later.  
– Hello sir, what seems to be a holdup? – the line manager greeted Chifs, shooting daggers at his subordinate.  
Chifs held up his datapad – Mark VII M drone. I have a permit – he said, gesturing to the large scanner that still held the big black box on wheels.  
The line manager walked up to the terminal, frowned, and started mashing buttons.  
– Wait, is that a military drone? – he stepped back, looking at the security guards.  
– I have a permit – sighed Chifs.  
The manager walked up to him, unsure, and scanned the file.  
– Security clearance tier 3? – he spoke aloud – now that's odd. But everything checks out. – Manager scratched his head. He touched his datapad to the scanner and the red warning turned green. A security guard wheeled the case behind the check line and stood by it, waiting.  
– Do you have anything else to declare? – the line manager asked  
– Fusion cell device – Chifs spoke, pointing to a small box on other side  
– Fusion cell?  
– I have a permit – he waved his datapad. Manager scanned it out of habit.  
– Brightest stars, that's an actual fusion cell.  
– Yup.  
– It's already checked in. Do you have anything else dangerous to declare? – manager asked, gesturing at remaining bags.  
– Standard exo cargo hauler, three cameras, camping supplies, food supplies, clothes – Chifs counted the large cases as line worker wheeled them through scanner.  
– Wait, cameras? – manager asked, staring at Chifs.  
– Do you need me to take them out for inspection? – he offered.  
– No. Are you a photographer? *That* photographer from the news?  
– I really don't like that photo... – Chifs protested.  
– You actually dropped a landmine on people?  
– It was in self-defense.  
– Damn. I don't have any more questions, sir – manager turned to his subordinate. – Sign the guy off. Have a nice day, sir.  
Manager looked at the fusion cell case, as Chifs picked it up to hide back in one of his large suitcases.  
– Would you like to take it into the cabin? – manager asked.  
– It can go into cargo hold – photographer shrugged.  
– No sir, I mean, you *have* to take it into the cabin. Security reasons.  
– Oh. You could have just said that.  
– Worker – manager spoke to the one who called him. – Upgrade this customer ticket to business class so he can stash all his valuable gear in the VIP luggage section.  
– Yes sir? – the worker was surprised, but complied, bringing up the flight plan on the terminal.   
– Your flight is in four hours, sir – manager noticed, glancing over.  
– I know. I came earlier, in case you have questions.  
– That is extremely appreciated – the manager almost bowed to Chifs.  
Security guards helped wheel all the checked baggage to the loading belt, and waved him goodbye.  

***  

– Why the special treatment, line manager, sir? – the line worker asked when Chifs left.  
– If that fusion cell becomes unstable, I want him as close to emergency airlock as possible – manager pointed at ship deck plans. – Also, he is a famous photographer. Or maybe even a secret agent, with all the gear and permits he has on him. It is business advantageous for us to give him a better seat, and keep him out of regular passengers' view.   
– Uh, sir, I just looked at his checked baggage. He has 40 kilos of ceramic plating fitted for an exosuit.  
– Ceramic plating?? Do we need to call an army? – manager got pale.  
– I already checked with port security, sir. It's grade C plating, the highest tier available to civilian security forces. He is allowed to have it – line worker explained.  
Manager relaxed.  
– Good job, worker. I will mark your today's performance as above average. Check the paperwork, twice, and you can have your break earlier.  
– Yes, sir, thank you, sir.

In the meantime, Chifs navigated his way to the premium lounge. It has been some time since he was here – he no longer flew business class, because he was always broke. So he spent the next couple of hours enjoying all the VIP services the lounge offered. Ah, the massage!  
The premium class seats on the liner were also comfortable, and with the curtain closed, he had his own private cabin.  
The flight took almost no time with such amenities.  

At his destination, he was greeted by a large human.  
– Dave! What are you doing here?  
– Came to make sure you don't run away. You promised my niece a wedding shot.  
– That's in a couple of weeks.  
– We need to get going. I have a shuttle booked.  
– Can I at least stash my gear? I don't want to bring a drone to a wedding.  
– Oh no, bring it with you, pal! Kids are going to love it! –  
Human helped him gather all the suitcases, and wheeled them off toward the landing pad.  
– Also, they guy I told you about will be on the wedding too, and he promised to bring his stuff.  
– Remind me, what does this friend of yours do again?  
– Lazers! – Dave grinned.  
– I promised gov no weapons on my drone – Chifs rolled his eyes.  
– Come on, just a small moon-destroying beam! – the human teased, leaning down to him.  
Of course he was going to get the deadly Lazers!  
Just maybe... after... the wedding shot.
