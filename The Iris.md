THE IRIS  

Study of Light.  
That was his life's calling.   
To study how light propagates, bounces or absorbs. The science of colours and waves.  
And now that Humanity was introduced, he obviously had to do the mandatory research on how they perceived light. He didn't expect any breakthroughs to be found, but new species often had new uncatalogued materials that could have interesting optical properties. Professor was looking forward to seeing the human research outpost and all of its "discoveries".  
And this young researcher was his tour guide.  
Quite energetic one, that was.  
– Come on, I have something interesting to show you – the human gestured to the door he opened.  
They entered a standard white lab. An elevated observation room, they were in, overlooked a square area below.  
– Here it is. The Iris. –   
The human moved its manipulator limbs in quick fashion, which professor knew from the species dossier indicated excitement or hurry.  
He walked to the glass and looked down into the room.  
There was a hole in the middle of the floor, going into unknown.  
"Ah yes" – he thought – "The Black Box experiment, where a nanographite coated tunnel would trap and absorb the light, giving the impression of total blackness. Pretty basic."  
Staring at it, he had to admit it was an excellent black, despite the very unsatisfying light source of the lab.  
The human unlocked a side hatch of the observation room and invited him to the research area below.  
Professor followed, to inspect the tunnel up close and make the courtesy measurement. Beyond the door were stairs. Humans for some reason loved such primitive solutions, where an automated lift would do. Professor asked why they don't use lifts, and human replied stairs are more reliable, when for example power goes out or something happens, and you have to run away from the room in hurry.   
– Wouldn't you just use drones for dangerous experiments? – he asked.  
– We never know when experiment becomes dangerous – replied human.  
That answer really puzzled professor.   
He did not have time to be puzzled with it for long, because they rounded the corner, and he stopped dead in his tracks.  
The research object was not a hole in the floor.  
It was a globe.  
He could clearly see it now, when he moved – the object was a globe of pure black, suspended on thin threads from corners of the containment cube. A globe so remarkably black, that even his sensitive eyes couldn't make a single wavelength of reflection.   
It was simply a hole in the visible spectrum.   
"How did they manage to produce material that had such low albedo, without access to quantum technology?" – he wondered.  
– May I inspect it? – professor asked, gesturing to the object.  
– Sure – human nodded – That's why I brought you here. I thought you would like to toy with the Iris.  
– Why would you call it "The Eye"? –  
For some reason, professor found it unsettling to call a perfectly absorbent object "an eye".  
– Oh, it's not "The Eye". – corrected the guide – Iris. The middle black spot on the eye – he explained, pointing at its vision apparatus.  
– Ah, I see. So it is a black box experiment.  
– A black box? – human tilted his head weirdly.  
– An enclosed space with specially shaped walls, designed to trap any incoming light.  
– Oh, yes, we did those.  
– Is there any suit I could use? – professor asked, looking around the room for any kind of lockers.  
– What for? – human asked  
– For inspecting the sphere. I do not want to cause contamination when reaching with my instruments beyond the protective field. How did you manage to create a field that does not disrupt high energy photons? – asked professor, inspecting the containment cube closer up.  
– Uh, there is no containment field around it.  
– No? – professor asked, puzzled.   
Did they assign him a beginner student as a guide, a clueless one in addition?  
– Are you sure? – professor asked – Our very presence and air we are breathing would cover it with microdust in seconds.  
– It is self-cleaning.  
– Self-cleaning?  
– Yeah.  
The human poked the ball.   
No student ever in his course would touch the research apparatus or samples with their bare unprotected manipulators. He wouldn't just expel them, he would expel them, report unsuitable for any kind of work requiring sentience, and sue for the damages in millions of galaxy credits.  
And this human just poked the sample???!!  
Professor was so shocked, he didn't even yell out.  

The spot human touched got dirty from his finger residue, barely visible to naked eye, but also blinding white bright for professor eyes, compared to rest of the sphere. He could make the big round friction patterns typical for human hands.  
Then, over the course of couple seconds, the finger mark faded, like it was never there.  
The sphere was pure black again.  

Professor stared at the scene dumbfounded.  
Did human just show him they have a material that is pure black AND self-cleaning?  
No, that is impossible.  
Maybe a closer analysis will reveal something.  

After ensuring, twice, that no containment suits are necessary, and no special precautions are needed, professor set down to work.  
From his portable research set, he took out the standard laser probe and shone it on the sphere.   
Nothing.  
Not even a fraction of detectable light. Not for his eyes, not for the spectrum analyser he brought up next.  
The composition scans from the active probe returned nothing. Like he was scanning empty space.  
Not nanographite. Not "unknown material". Just simply nothing. "Sample too far" insisted the device.  
The thing just absorbed all radiation directed at it.  
Not even the two-piece portable x-ray and gamma ray scanner could give any hint, other than confirming the object actually existed. It appeared as a round 'shade', with uniform infinite density throughout the whole profile.  
Next, he weighted the object, including the cubic frame and the stand – he did not dare dismounting the sample from the holding device.  
Human helped him set the sample on the mass-calculating-device, which gave a reading of 73 kilograms. Even deducting the weight of the stand and holding assembly, the sphere must have had a mass of at least 60 kilograms.  
Given the sphere was only 12 centimeters wide, its density exceeded any known material, except neutronium, of course.     
– What is this made from? – professor asked  
– Some quantum stuff. –  

The more professor inspected the perfectly black sphere, the Iris, the more he was confused.  
No, no material would be so absorbent. And if it was, it would be literally boiling inside.  
It was like a hole in the world.  
A hole...  

The professor screamed, ran to the stairs, and up a couple steps. If he had a mind clear enough to think at this moment, he would have agreed stairs were superior to painfully slow moving lifts.  
– Is this... is this... a quantum stable black hole? – he asked, cowering behind the railing.  
– Uh, I'm not sure what you mean – the human replied, visibly unbothered by close proximity of an extremely dangerous object, nor by professor's violent reaction.  
– This shouldn't exist. It cannot exist! – professor yelled. – How did you make it?  
– Well, that's a question to guys from quantum physics department. From what I know, they just used that huge particle accelerator we have here to make this. It had some interesting properties, so now we keep it here for testing.  

– May I touch it? – the professor asked, after convincing himself that quantum stable black holes are not real and thus cannot hurt him, and managed to come back to the black sphere and his scattered equipment.  
– Sure.  
Professor used the back end of his laser measurement tool to poke the object. If it has a solid surface, it is not a black hole.   
This experiment has succeeded only halfway.  
The laser probe indeed met a surface.  
It also stuck to said surface immediately, and professor could not pull it back. This wasn't magnetic or static attraction, the tool was made from non-magnetic, charge-free materials. It was also a single solid piece. And currently hanging on the side of the sphere.   
– Ah, yes, that happens when you touch things to it – commented human.  
Professor tried to pull the probe off, but it only pulled the sphere to him, straining the threads. They unrolled on a spring.  
Whatever force was holding his tool, he could not overpower it with his muscles alone.  
– Please don't pull too hard, we don't want it to drop to the floor like last time. – human warned – We had to pry the floor tile.  
– Why?  
– It gets stuck really good. You won't be able to pull it off if it's a solid piece. I can get you an angle grinder before it all gets pulled in.  
– Pulled in?  
– Yeah, it will sink inside slowly.  
– Sink?? – professor started to breathe faster again.  
– Yeah. We once put a steel bar on it. It got kind of crushed and bent as it got pulled in.  
– It pulls things in with no way out??! – the professor yelled  
– Yeah. That's how it keeps itself clean we think.  

For the next hour, professor sat on the stairs, slumped over in a pose of utter despair, observing how his laser probe slowly disappears in a menacing black sphere.  
The human brought him snacks from the local cantina, disregarding the question about lab space cleanliness.  
They also offered to replace the lost measurement instrument, but professor refused.  
The loss of instrument was of no consequence.  
His mind was weighted heavily by the actual direness of the situation.  
He could barely hear what human was saying to him.  
– ... so we are not sure how we got this one, but we should be able to replicate the process soon. We thought of making thin flat versions to be used as coatings. –  
This was all the professor could take. He ran out of the lab screaming. He was screaming on his way to the landing pad, and he was screaming as he entered his personal shuttle. The computer could not understand the destination, so he punched the big blue "Emergency return" button. And slumped down in his chair.  

The humans have just constructed a quantum stable BLACK HOLE in their lab.  
And they were actively trying to make MORE.

Professor Xarhlyphyx, AORD, to the High Board of Research, urgent.  

Please forgive me for break of protocol and presenting my conclusions before the research data.  
The humans have created a quantum stable BLACK HOLE.  
I attach the unedited footage from my visit, and an index file highlighting key moments.  
I request your quick action on the matter.  

With urgency  
Professor Xarhlyphyx, of Advanced Optics Research Division.
